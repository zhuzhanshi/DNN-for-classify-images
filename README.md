# deep_neural_network

This work is used to classify images, which is from DeepLearing.ai, Cousera, Class 1.
'''
datasets
To store the images.

'''
dnn.py
the model of dnn.
it is a class, coded by python and numpy.

'''
check.py
to run the dnn with preprocessing.
build a model like[12288, 7, 1], and you can add layers or modify the nodes in every layer.

'''
run   
python check.py
